What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you create a repository git creates a .git folder to keep track of all the changes that you make to your files in that folder.
This is created so you can attach everything you have in certain folder to git, if you dont initialize a repository you wont be able to commit it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Since the working directory is where you have your files in the computer, and the repository is just a folder/project of how you want to call it, that git just keep track of, we could say that the staging area is just something that you tell it, hey, i want to commit, this and this, aand this, but wait until my confirmation.
The staging area allows you to i dont know maybe regret a commit or rethink it before you do it.
