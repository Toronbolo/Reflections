When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I am working in several computers, committing it to git hub would be useful to keep all my computer's 
    work up to date.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because not always my work will be actually what i want, what if i change my mind and want to delete the file i just made? or the changes... is better if i do it manually so i know exactly what i have.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are just copies of an existing repository in github, it is usually from another person
    Clones allows you too take one repository from github or your computer and copy it to either of then
    Branches are just a way to make changes in your files in a different timeline (we could say it like that) 
    allowing you to avoid messing up with your original files in the main timeline.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
